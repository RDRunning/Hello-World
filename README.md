# Hello-World
The beginning.
Devaiah here. I believe everything is temporary, Pain and Pleasure too. So hold on and enjoy the crazy ride called life.
Like the Buddha says, Life is suffering, I'm trying to learn the art of detachment. 
Be like water- cool, calm, formless without boundaries but with enormous potential energy to bring everything and everyone else to its knees.
